# ! Warning !
Although the code in this repo tries its best to be non-destructive, it has a big potential
to mess up the machine it's running on - so you should probably run it in a disposable VM.

# What is this
This is a tool to launch a swarm of asssisted service agents that look
to the service like actual cluster host agents, all the way from discovery to completed
installation and controller progress reports.

This repo also contains helper scripts to deploy & manage the relevant CRs for assisted
kube-api installation, and running the agents described above to connect to said CRs.

# Background
Originally, the assisted installer service has been load-tested by installing actual clusters
on thousands of VMs. That approach has the advantage of testing the real thing - complete e2e OCP
assisted installation - it gave an accurate representation of the load on the service and also
helped find rare installation bugs. However, using this method is very costly and requires a
lot of machines to host all these VMs. Since this amount of hardware is not always immediately
available, a need arose to find a cheaper, less hardware-intensive way to load test
the service.

I considered two approaches:

1. Complete emulation - using tools such as JMeter or Locust, or writing custom fake agents that
 behave like real one, then running a lot of that on a single machine. 

2. No-op agent - use the existing agent, as is, let it do everything it usually does - but replace
 destructive actions such as installation, disk wiping, etc. with no-ops. The controller that runs
 on the cluster (the cluster which doesn't exist in this case) will simply run locally, and will
 also be modified to use mocked kube-api calls that cause it to feel like it's running on an 
 actual cluster.

Option (1) is definitely possible, but I felt it would be hard to maintain it and keep it up to date
with all the API changes / agent behavior changes that will be added in the future. 

Option (2) is what this repo is.

# Out-of-scope / TODO
- BMAC testing - there's no bare metal emulation here
- Image service load testing - at no point during the swarm

# Technical
This repo allows you to build & run a customized no-op version of:
- The assisted installer agent
- The assisted installer 
- The assisted controller

The customization is done by applying a series of patch files that
modify the source code of the agent & installer/controller repositories,
then building them and publishing their images to quay.

The service-under-test can then be modified to use those custom images.

You can then use the provided scripts under `manifests/` to deploy n-replicas
of the assisted installation CRs. (The configuration and exact number of replicas
can be configured and set in the `manifests/manifests-data.example.json')

`./launch_all.sh` will automatically discover all the infraenvs that were created,
and will launch n agents matching those infraenvs on the host where the script is ran.

The agents should behave just like real agents as much as possible. This is achieved
via the patches described below.

# Patches
The agent and installer/controller repositories had to be modified to make them fit
to be ran inside the swarm. This section describes/documents the various patches that
get applied to achieve that.

Note: ideally, we should slowly move those patches up-stream and give the real agent/installer/controller
a "simulator" mode so those patches don't have to be maintained separately in this repo.

## Agent Patches
The following changes are being applied to the agent repo -
- Change image registry path from `quay.io/ocpmetal/assisted-installer-agent:latest`
  to `quay.io/otuchfel/assisted-installer-agent:swarm`. Should probably make this customizable.

- Change Makefile "docker" usage to "podman". We use podman to run the swarm, so the images
  that get built should be in the podman cache and not the docker cache.

- Read agent host-id from the usually ommitted `--host-id` flag, rather than generating
  the ID from hardware. This allows us to run many different agents with different IDs,
  rather than having them all have the same ID because they're all running on the same
  hardware. <- This can be up-streamed! If --host-id is given, use it instead of 
  getting it from the hardware, no harm done.

- Append host ID to step-containers names - The service tells the agent to launch containers
  using the next-step-runner - sometimes the service hardcodes a container name for those
  containers. This cannot work in a swarm because the different swarm agents will each try
  to create those containers, and we cannot have their names collide. We solve that by appending
  the host-id to the service container name. <- This can be up-streamed! It works great for the
  swarm use-case and doesn't interfere with the regular use-case, so there's no harm in upstreaming
  it.

- Replace `dd` with `true` - To avoid deleting the disks of the host running the swarm, we 
  intercept the `install` step and replace its `dd if=...` invocations with `true if=...` 
  invocations that don't really do anything.

- Enter CGroup namespace when the next-step-runner container launches containers on its host
  by adding the `-C` flag to `nsenter`. This fixes a bug where the next-step-runner is unable
  to launch containers using podman on some systemd based distros (this is not a problem on RHCOS,
  where the agent typically runs, which is why it was not needed on the original agent). <- This
  can be upstreamed! There's no harm in joining the cgroup namespace of the host before launching
  containers on the host.

## Installer Patches
The following changes are being applied to the installer in the installer repo -
- Change image registry path from `quay.io/ocpmetal/assisted-installer:latest`
  to `quay.io/otuchfel/assisted-installer:swarm`. Should probably make this customizable.

- Comment out destructive lines in `cleanupInstallDevice`

- Call the `swarm-installer` "binary" rather than the `coreos-installer` binary. You can see what this
  "binary" does instead - it's included in this repository.

- Disable `efibootmgr` calls - don't want to mess with the host's EFI entries.

- WIP


## Controller Patches
The following changes are being applied to the controller in the installer repo -
- Change image registry path from `quay.io/ocpmetal/assisted-installer-controller:latest`
  to `quay.io/otuchfel/assisted-installer-controller:swarm`. Should probably make this customizable.

- Replace k8s_client package with a mock, configure mock to behave like a slowly initializing
  cluster as much as we reasonably can.

- Disable HackDNSAddressConflict - it's too complicated to mock k8s API calls for this and there
  service could't care less about it, so just disable it altogether.

- WIP
